# Net-Zero-Carbon-Emission
Providing a better world for our future generation is one of our primary duty as fellow human beings. Emission of CO2, wastage of food and other resources in an uncontrollable manner is something that needs to be taken care of. To overcome this, every company/organization (private/public) need to take some preventive measures.
Carbon footprints can be tracked real-time while it is made to pass out through a common outlet.
Poor monitoring of electrical and electronic appliances causes unwanted energy loss. Proper monitoring can be done by using IoT technology. Employees / Users can be provided with ID cards which can be used to detect the presence of humans in a particular room and accordingly, the appliances can be used.
Wastage of food can also be minimized by using IoT. This can be done by fetching the available details of various products such as the expiry date, the remaining stock, and the items that are overstocked(not sold out as expected).These data can be processed over a certain period of time and effective solution can be obtained.

# Solution
## Tracking the real-time carbon footprint:
The carbon footprint of an organization can be monitored by detecting the presence of greenhouse gases like Carbon dioxide(CO2) in the outlet effluent gas.This detection can be done by gas sensors. The detected CO2 values are processed by the microcontroller and the resultant composition levels are recorded.These recorded values can be used to monitor the trend(increase/decrease) of emission of greenhouse gases. 
## Optimizing energy consumption:
The efficient use of electricity in a corporate firm can help streamline its economy solely in its development . There are many existing solutions(OpenCV, IR, capacitive sensors) to monitor the human density in a geographical area. But all are not suited for an office environment. Our proposed solution is that each hall should have an RFID sensor to let employees inside . Thereby the employee density inside the hall can be calculated and thus sufficient air conditioning can be provided.
## Reducing food wastage through IoT:
Details like the expiry date of different products, how much stock is left, which products are overstocked, and which are not are monitored by sensors(like temperature, and proximity sensors) and are updated in the database regularly.
IoT sensors also identify and categorize products based on how fast they rot so that distribution can be executed accordingly.
